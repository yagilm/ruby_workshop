E: make the code easy to change, 
P: running algorithms multiple times
I: pick up code using your parent's code ("not smth you need to encourage") , code reuse but also code coupling

# Test and codet

Task -> Design -> Test -> Code -> (test-code-test-code) -> Integration (->ship) -> Task....

See task, think of design, write tests
First write the tests, then write code that passes the tests.
the test is a model on how the code should function

The example is the Rectangle definition and test.
- Create class-> write tests -> make the functions that satisfy the tests


# Encapsulation
Check 'Encapsulation and Inheritance'

# Class relationshipts
Inheritance
Composition ("buy" other objects)
Collaboration (example: java: collection and iterator)
